Michael lays it all out:

> At SeedPlus we have a triangle that we follow when investing in Southeast Asian startups.  Team, market, and strategy.  The market has to be big enough.  You will see some amazing people with amazing products but no offense to them the market is never going to be that big.  Therefore it is not really a venture business, so in those cases, we will pass.  However, if they can show that there is a big enough market.  Also, we think the team has the pedigree to do it and we like their strategy.  Then we will definitely dig in.

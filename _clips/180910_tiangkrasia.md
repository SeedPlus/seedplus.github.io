Tiang speaks to Elaine Huang of KrASIA:

> **KrASIA:** What’s your advice to seed stage startup founders in Singapore having difficulty raising capital?
>
> **Tiang:** To begin, take a step back and really ask yourself if you should be raising capital at all. Some businesses are not meant to be venture scale and that is okay; maybe that’s the reason why you have difficulty fundraising.

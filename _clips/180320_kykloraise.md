Jon Russell writes a long profile on [Kyklo](https://www.kyklo.co/), that also breaks the news of our fundraising:

> “Right now we’re looking at which two countries we will do in Europe, and where we will go in the U.S.,” Ducrocq said.
> 
> In order to aid that expansion, Kyklo has raised funding from investors that include Singapore-based duo **SeedPlus** and [Wavemaker Partners](https://wavemaker.vc/).

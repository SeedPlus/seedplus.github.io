We have recently added a section to our website so that we could communicate more regularly about our events, links to stuff about our companies, and Project Alpha.

In regards to Project Alpha we have concluded all of our city events, thanks to all who attended, and we have close pitch submissions. We are in the process of meeting startups in Thailand and will reach out to the Singapore submissions next. Then we will selecting the finalists and announcing them on **October 29th**.

Again - thanks to everyone who attended, submitted or helped produce the 2018 program. We will be announcing details about next year before the end of the year.

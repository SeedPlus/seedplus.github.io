We teamed up with [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for a fireside chat on *Building machine learning 
based products* with both local luminaries and visiting experts: [Kelvin Law](https://twitter.com/kelvl) joins from Stripe where he builds ML-based anti-fraud systems at scale, while the early-stage angle will be covered by [Jin Hian Lee](https://twitter.com/jinhian_lee), co-founder of the virtual assistant startup [Mimetic](https://mimetic.ai) and [Mohammed Abdoolcarim](https://twitter.com/goteamups), ex-Siri and co-founder of [Vahan](http://vahan.co/).
